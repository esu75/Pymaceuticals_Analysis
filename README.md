# Pymaceuticals_Analysis

A new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.As a senior data analyst at the company, you've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals’ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.
The executive team has tasked you with generating all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study. They have also asked you for a top-level summary of the study results.

This project is broken down to the following tasks:

•	Prepare the data.

•	Generate summary statistics.

•	Create bar charts and pie charts.

•	Calculate quartiles, find outliers, and create a box plot.

•	Create a line plot and a scatter plot.

•	Calculate correlation and regression.

•	present your final analysis report.

# Final Analysis
1.	In reference to the bar chart of mice per drug regimen, there are 10 unique treatments used for the study. The highest number of mice in the study are treated using Capomulin. while the lowest number of mice in the study are treated using Propriva.
2.	In reference to the box plot across four regimens of interest & summary statistics table, the final tumor volume treated by Capomulin and Ramicane trended lower than the others. Ramicane demonstrated lower final tumor volume, however it was used with a lower treatment than that of Capomulin. Fair results require equal treatments and variables.
3.	Capolmulin was used to treat Mouse ID l509 and the tumor volume seems to decrease with time. Sampling also charts that five mice treated with the same regimen supports the assumption that Capomulin could reduce the size of tumor volume.
4.	In reference to the correlation between Capomulin with average weight and final tumor volume, the value is 0.84, meaning that there is a strong positive correlation between the two variables. The r-squared value of 0.71 indicates that the final tumor volume could be predicted by using the average weight of a mouse.
